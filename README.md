# Analysis on Starbucks Drinks

## Motivation  

Recently, *fats* have become one of the people's concerns for their health. The truth is that not all fats are bad. According to [Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good), we should avoid eating trans fat and limit saturated fat intake, replacing them with healthful unsaturated fat. It creates a motivation to explore different fat amounts in Starbucks drinks and whether there is an option to eliminate bad fats and increase good ones. In addition, many people wonder if these drinks can be treated as a meal. This leads to another question about the percentage of nutrient intake with respect to average daily values.

It can be summarised into two research questions: 

1. What is the amount of trans fat, saturated fat, and unsaturated fat in Starbucks drinks? Which factors contribute to those fats?

2. What is the average daily intake percentage of nutrients for different categories of drinks?

**About the data**

The dataset from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-12-21/readme.md#starbuckscsv) (2021) contains the official nutrition of Starbucks drinks, retrieved from the document [Starbucks Coffee Company Beverage Nutrition Information](https://globalassets.starbucks.com/assets/94fbcc2ab1e24359850fa1870fc988bc.pdf). There is no missing value in this dataset.

## Conclusion

The total fat in most Starbucks drinks is less than 10g, mainly saturated fat, which is intuitively not a big threat to consumersâ€™ health. However, a deeper insight reveals that the drinks contain trans fat, bad unsaturated fat that should be avoided as much as possible. The trans fat comes from 2% milk, whole milk, and especially extra whipped cream that is added to the drinks. The best solution to eliminate trans fat for Starbucks lovers is to tell the barista to use non-fat, soy, or coconut milk when ordering a drink that includes milk. Whipped cream also must be avoided to make the drinks zero trans-fat.

On the other hand, a drink obviously could not replace lunch or dinner since it does not contain sufficient macronutrients. The drink does not provide enough calories and energy for a person to get through the day. It is more reasonable to consume them in addition to daily meals. However, sugar is exceedingly high in these drinks. Since the FDA (2022) suggests no more than 50g of added sugar per day, the amount in Frappuccino and Hot chocolate is considered excessive. Health-conscious people should seek better options from Coffee, Refreshers, and Tea. If not, they could order Frappuccino and Hot chocolate in a smaller size.
